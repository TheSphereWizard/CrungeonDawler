public class Level {
	//Not Today but Plan:
	//Start is center -Rand room or special center room
	//on each "entrance" -need special tile for this -not sure how nultiple wide doors will work
	//try and place random room, if it fits then place it and continue else try
	//another room type, if all rooms are invalid give up and replace with wall
	
	//also need to have outer bound, probably just square around level
